Affects sampling probability (lower for less repetition, higher for more randomness)
Affects audio variety (lower is too rigid, higher adds more variety)
Affects audio randomness and variation (lower is more fixed, higher is more varied)
Affects audio speed (lower slows down, higher speeds up)
Affects inference speed (lower reduces GPU load, higher increases GPU load)
Performance optimization threshold (lower uses more performance, higher takes less time)
Affects inference speed (on is faster but consumes more, off is slower but consumes less)
